Data_scapes:
A study and exploration of data extraction and its possible inferences
by Sarah Hontoy-Major

Welcome to my experimentation on online data extraction. 
To run the program, download the folder and all subsequent dependencies of the Node framework (running the command 'npm install' in the folder's terminal); 
and run 'npm start'.

The app should be listening on:
localport:4200/client.html

No further action should be required to access the app. The experimentation is rather small and does not take a long time to complete, as only a few seconds is required for all pop-up messages to load unto the client's screen. You can close the pop-up messages, but they will reappear after a few seconds. There is not much else to interact with on the page.
